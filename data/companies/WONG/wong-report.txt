• IF margins recover to 9-10% range by FY2026
• AND infrastructure boom drives 20%+ annual revenue growth
• AND construction segment scales to 30-40% of revenue mix
• THEN WONG could be significant value opportunity at current RM10m market cap

→ Potential upside: 2-3x over 2-3 years if execution successful
→ Target margin: 9-10% (vs current 6.2%)
→ Target revenue: RM150-180m annualized (vs current ~RM135m run rate)

Value Trap Risk (Bear Scenario):
• IF margins remain depressed at 6-7% due to structural cost pressures
• AND small scale prevents competing effectively for large projects
• AND quarterly volatility persists due to lumpy project revenue
• THEN WONG remains subscale, low-profitability business

→ Downside: Further derating, potential delisting if losses occur
→ Risk: Small market cap makes exit difficult if thesis breaks

• Profit: RM16-20m annually
• Valuation: 5-7x P/E (still modest for profitable small-cap)
• Market Cap: RM80-140m (8-14x current RM10m)
• Stock Price: RM0.32-0.56 (8-14x upside from RM0.04)

Return Potential: 8-14x (700-1,300% return over 3 years)
Probability: MODERATE (35-40% chance of full bull case realization)

BEAR CASE (Pessimistic Scenario):

Thesis: "Structurally challenged microcap unable to compete effectively"

Key Risks:
1. Margin Trap: 6.2% margins insufficient for profitability, trend deteriorates further
2. Scale Disadvantage: Cannot compete for large contracts, stuck in low-margin niche
3. Capital Constraints: Unable to invest in automation/growth, competitiveness erodes
4. Quarterly Volatility: Lumpy project revenue prevents consistent profitability
5. Cost Inflation: Cannot pass through rising costs, buyers have leverage

Downside Triggers:
• Q3-Q4 FY2025 show margin backsliding to 5% or lower
• Loss of major customer or contract cancellations announced
• Unable to participate meaningfully in infrastructure boom (too small)
• Working capital stress or need for dilutive equity raise

Downside Target (2-year view):
• Revenue: Volatile, no sustained growth (RM100-140m range)
• Margin: 4-6% (persistently depressed)
• Profit: RM4-8m annually (insufficient for small-cap premium)
• Valuation: 1-2x P/E (further derating on poor fundamentals)
• Market Cap: RM4-10m (flat to down 60%)
• Stock Price: RM0.02-0.04 (50% downside to flat)

Downside Risk: -50% to -80% if delisting scenario
Probability: MODERATE-LOW (25-30% chance of severe bear case)

BASE CASE (Most Likely Scenario):

Thesis: "Challenged small-cap with gradual improvement, limited upside"

Realistic Expectations:
1. Margin Recovery: Gradual improvement to 7-8% over 2-3 years (not full restoration)
2. Revenue Growth: 10-15% annually (infrastructure tailwind helps, but scale limits)
3. Profitability: Consistent but modest, RM10-15m annual profit by FY2027
4. Valuation: Re-rates to 3-5x P/E as stability returns
5. Market Cap: RM30-75m (3-7.5x current RM10m)

Base Case Return: 3-7.5x (200-650% return over 3-4 years)
Probability: HIGH (45-50% chance of base case outcome)

INVESTMENT DECISION FRAMEWORK:

Position Sizing Guidance:
• Aggressive Small-Cap Investors: 3-5% of portfolio (high conviction)
• Moderate Risk Tolerance: 1-2% of portfolio (satellite position)
• Conservative Investors: 0% (avoid entirely)

Entry Strategy:
• Avoid "all-in" at current levels despite low valuation
• Scale in over 2-3 quarters as margin recovery validates
• Initial position: 1/3 of intended allocation

• Final 1/3 if Q4 FY2025 confirms sustained improvement

Exit Strategy:
• Profit-taking: Scale out 1/3 at 3x, 1/3 at 6x, runner for 10x+
• Stop-loss: Exit if margins fall below 5% for 2 consecutive quarters
• Time-stop: Re-evaluate after 2 years if no progress on margin recovery
• Full exit: If delisting risk materializes or major customer loss

Monitoring Checklist (Quarterly):
□ Profit margin trend (target: 7%+ and rising)
□ Revenue consistency (target: RM30-35m+ per quarter)
□ Gross margin (indicates pricing power and operational efficiency)
□ Major contract announcements or customer wins
□ Management commentary on cost initiatives and outlook
□ Peer valuation comparison (sector re-rating or derating?)
□ Bursa minimum market cap compliance (avoid delisting risk)

COMPARABLE VALUATION (Indicative):

Larger Engineering/Industrial Peers (Rough Benchmarks):
• Typical P/E: 8-15x for profitable, stable companies
• Typical P/S: 0.5-1.5x for engineering/manufacturing
• Small-cap discount: -30% to -50% vs large-cap multiples

WONG's Current Discount:
• At 1.2x P/E, trading at ~85-92% discount to peer average
• At 0.07x P/S, trading at ~86-95% discount to peer average

Justification for Discount:
• Illiquidity: Difficult to buy/sell meaningful size
• Small scale: Cannot compete for large contracts
• Margin pressure: Profitability concerns
• Volatility: Earnings unpredictability
• However: Discount appears EXCESSIVE even accounting for above

Potential Rerating:
• IF margins recover to 8-9% and stabilize
• AND quarterly revenue sustains at RM32-35m+
• THEN valuation could re-rate to 5-8x P/E (still below peers)
• Implies market cap RM40-80m = 4-8x upside from RM10m current

FINAL INVESTMENT PERSPECTIVE:

WONG Engineering (7050) represents a HIGHLY SPECULATIVE, HIGH-RISK, HIGH-REWARD
opportunity suitable ONLY for investors with:
✅ Strong risk tolerance and small-cap experience
✅ Ability to conduct ongoing quarterly monitoring
✅ Long-term investment horizon (3-5 years)
✅ Conviction in Malaysia infrastructure growth story
✅ Comfort with illiquid microcap positions
✅ Portfolio capacity for 1-3% speculative allocation

The extreme valuation discount (0.07x P/S, ~1.2x P/E) suggests market has largely
given up on the stock, creating potential asymmetric opportunity IF management can
execute on margin recovery and capture infrastructure boom growth.

However, significant risks remain:
⚠️ Margin compression may be structural, not cyclical
⚠️ Small scale limits ability to compete effectively
⚠️ Quarterly volatility makes trend assessment difficult
⚠️ Capital constraints prevent aggressive growth investment

RECOMMENDATION:
For suitable investors, consider SMALL INITIAL POSITION (0.5-1% of portfolio) with
plan to scale up if Q3-Q4 FY2025 results validate margin recovery thesis. Monitor
closely and be prepared to exit quickly if fundamentals deteriorate further.

NOT RECOMMENDED for conservative investors or those requiring income/stability.

      margins step-by-step."

Content Structure:
• Basics: What is a profit margin? (Profit ÷ Revenue)
• Why margins matter: Better predictor of quality than revenue growth
• Types of margins:
  - Gross margin: Revenue - COGS (production efficiency)
  - Operating margin: Includes SG&A (operational efficiency)
  - Net margin: Bottom line after all expenses
• WONG case study:
  - Historical margins: 10-12% (good for manufacturing)
  - Current margin: 6.2% (compressed, concerning)
  - QoQ trend: 5.2% → 6.2% (recovery in progress?)
• What drives margin changes:
  - Input costs (commodities, labor, energy)
  - Pricing power (can company pass through costs?)
  - Product mix (higher-margin vs. lower-margin work)
  - Operating leverage (fixed costs spread over more revenue)
• Red flags:
  - Sustained margin decline = competitive pressure or cost inflation
  - Revenue growth + margin decline = potentially unprofitable growth
• Green flags:
  - Margin expansion = improving efficiency or pricing power
  - Stable margins through cycles = competitive moat
• WONG's situation: Which is it? Monitor Q3/Q4 to determine trend direction

CONTENT PILLAR 4: "Contrarian & Debate Content"

Video/Post Idea #8: "Why I'm Watching WONG Engineering (Despite the Red Flags)"
Format: Contrarian investment thesis video (8-12 minutes)
Hook: "Everyone says don't catch falling knives. But what if the market is too pessimistic?"

Content Structure:
• Acknowledge the bearish case:
  - Margin compression (11.5% → 6.2%)
  - Tiny market cap (RM10.1m - illiquid, risky)
  - Quarterly volatility (unpredictable earnings)
  - Small scale (can't compete for big contracts)
• Present the contrarian bull case:
  - Extreme valuation: 0.07x P/S, ~1.2x P/E (market has given up)
  - Sequential recovery: Margins improving QoQ (5.2% → 6.2%)
  - Infrastructure catalyst: RM58.8B pipeline creates multi-year tailwind
  - Semiconductor exposure: NIMP 2030 supports precision engineering demand
  - Asymmetric risk/reward: Limited downside at current price vs. 5-10x upside if recovery
• The "cigar butt" investment philosophy:
  - Explain Benjamin Graham's approach: cheap + catalyst = opportunity
  - WONG fits profile: deeply discounted + clear catalyst (infrastructure boom)
  - Requires patience and strong stomach for volatility
• My approach: Small position (1-2% of portfolio), monitor quarterly for 2 years
• Success criteria: Margins back to 8%+, revenue consistently RM30m+/quarter
• Exit triggers: Margins fall below 5%, loss-making quarters, delisting risk

Engagement Strategy:
• Invite debate: "Am I crazy? Or is this a hidden opportunity?"
• Create poll: "WONG at RM0.04 - Contrarian play or value trap?"
• Follow-up commitment: "I'll update you every quarter on how this thesis plays out"

| Liquidity | Very poor | Good | Peer (tradability) |
| Risk Level | Very high | Moderate | Peer (safety) |
| Upside Potential | 5-10x if recovery | 1.5-2x steady growth | WONG (if speculative) |

Investment Recommendation:
• Conservative portfolio: 100% Larger Peer, 0% WONG
• Balanced portfolio: 85-90% Larger Peer, 10-15% WONG (satellite position)
• Aggressive portfolio: 50-70% Larger Peer, 30-50% WONG (if high conviction)

Conclusion: "Different tools for different goals"
• WONG = lottery ticket with decent odds (infrastructure catalyst)
• Peer = steady compounder for core holding
