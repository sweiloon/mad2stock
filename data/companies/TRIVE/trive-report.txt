================================================================================
SECTION 1: YoY & QoQ CATEGORY ANALYSIS
================================================================================

CATEGORY CLASSIFICATION: Category 5 - Turnaround Success
Performance Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5 - Strong Recovery)

KEY METRICS ANALYSIS:
✅ Revenue Growth YoY:  +50.0% (Exceptional growth)
✅ Profit Turnaround:   From LOSS to PROFIT (Category-defining achievement)
✅ QoQ Profit Surge:    +1,097% (10x increase quarter-over-quarter!)
✅ YoY Profit Growth:   +136.4% (More than doubled)

DETAILED BREAKDOWN:

YoY Performance (Year-over-Year):
Q1 FY2026 vs Q1 FY2025:
• Revenue: +50.0% growth (RM 4.4M → RM 6.6M estimated)
• Net Profit: +136.4% growth (RM 0.85M → RM 2.0M estimated)
• The company successfully TURNED AROUND from previous loss position
• This is the textbook definition of Category 5: Turnaround

QoQ Performance (Quarter-over-Quarter):
Q1 FY2026 vs Q4 FY2025:
• Revenue: Strong growth continuation
• Net Profit: +1,097% (11x increase!)
• This 10-bagger QoQ profit growth is EXCEPTIONAL
• Indicates either: (a) Seasonal business cycle peak, or
                    (b) Major contract/project completion, or
                    (c) Operational efficiency breakthrough

CATEGORY 5 CHARACTERISTICS:
Companies in this category exhibit:
1. ✅ Transition from losses to profitability (TRIVE achieved this)
2. ✅ Strong revenue acceleration (50% YoY qualifies)
3. ✅ Improving margins and operational efficiency
4. ✅ Positive ROE (1.67% - turned positive from negative)
5. ⚠️  Sustainability question remains (is this turnaround permanent?)

CRITICAL ANALYSIS:

🔍 The 1,097% QoQ Profit Surge - What's Behind It?
This is NOT normal organic growth. Possible explanations:
→ Large solar project completion (revenue recognition in Q1)
→ Government renewable energy incentive/grant received
→ One-time gain from property sale or asset monetization
→ Major contract win with upfront payment
→ Seasonal peak in renewable energy demand

⚠️ SUSTAINABILITY CONCERN:
While turnaround is confirmed, the critical question is:
"Can TRIVE maintain RM 2.0M quarterly profit going forward?"

If Q1 FY2026 was a one-off bumper quarter:
→ Q2-Q4 may revert to lower profit levels
→ Stock could correct after reality sets in

If Q1 FY2026 represents new baseline:
→ Annualized profit = RM 8M/year
→ Stock is SEVERELY undervalued (more on this in Section 2)

RISK FACTORS:
⚠️  Revenue concentration: Renewable energy sector (solar) is lumpy
    → Project-based revenue can fluctuate wildly quarter-to-quarter
⚠️  Low ROE (1.67%): While positive, still very low return on equity
    → Company not yet efficiently deploying shareholder capital
⚠️  Small scale: RM 6.6M quarterly revenue is modest
    → One lost contract could reverse turnaround
⚠️  Renewable energy policy risk: Dependent on government incentives (FiT, NEM)

POSITIVE CATALYSTS:
✅ Proven turnaround execution (loss to profit achieved)
✅ Revenue growth momentum (+50% YoY)
✅ Renewable energy sector tailwinds (Malaysia's green energy push)
✅ Low base effect (small company, easier to grow)
✅ Undervalued on P/B (0.22x) - trading 78% below book value

MARGIN ANALYSIS:
Q1 FY2026 Net Margin:
• Net Profit RM 2.0M / Revenue RM 6.6M = 30.3% net margin
• This is EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH for renewable energy distribution
• Either: (a) One-time high-margin project, or
          (b) Company has pricing power, or
          (c) Cost base has been dramatically reduced

Comparison:
• Typical solar distribution margins: 5-15%
• TRIVE achieving 30%+ suggests project-based lumpiness

NEXT QUARTER WATCH:
🎯 Q2 FY2026 results will be CRITICAL to confirm sustainability
   → If Q2 profit >RM 1.5M, turnaround is REAL and sustainable
   → If Q2 profit <RM 0.5M, Q1 was likely one-off project

================================================================================
SECTION 2: BUY/SELL SIGNALS & INVESTMENT ANALYSIS
================================================================================

INVESTMENT RECOMMENDATION: SPECULATIVE BUY with Quarterly Monitoring
Risk Level: MEDIUM-HIGH | Timeframe: 6-12 months | Position Size: 3-5% max

SHORT-TERM OUTLOOK (1-3 months):
Signal: ⚠️ CAUTIOUS BUY - Waiting for Q2 Confirmation
• Current price RM 0.020 is at 52-week mid-low range
• Stock has retraced from high of RM 0.045 (-56% from peak)
• Support level: RM 0.015 (near recent trading low)
• Resistance level: RM 0.030 (psychological barrier)

Technical Setup:
→ Bid/Ask spread: RM 0.015/0.020 (25% spread - very illiquid!)
→ Volume: 14,700 shares today (very low liquidity)
→ Price near support - decent risk/reward for entry

Short-term trader strategy:
→ Accumulate between RM 0.015-0.020
→ Stop-loss at RM 0.012 (below 52-week low buffer)
→ First target RM 0.030 (50% gain)
→ Second target RM 0.040 (100% gain, near 52-week high)

⚠️ CRITICAL CAVEAT:
Entry NOW is speculative because we don't know if Q1's stellar results
are sustainable or one-off. Wait for Q2 results for confirmation.

MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK (3-6 months):
Signal: 🔄 BUY on Q2 Confirmation / SELL on Q2 Disappointment

Scenario A: Q2 FY2026 shows continued strong profit (>RM 1.5M)
→ STRONG BUY signal - turnaround is real
→ Stock could re-rate to RM 0.040-0.060 (100-200% upside)
→ Accumulate aggressively on any dips

Scenario B: Q2 FY2026 shows weak profit (<RM 0.5M)
→ SELL signal - Q1 was one-off project
→ Stock could retest RM 0.010-0.015 support
→ Exit positions to preserve capital

KEY CATALYSTS TO WATCH:
✅ Q2 FY2026 results announcement (Apr-May 2026) - CRITICAL
✅ New solar project announcements
✅ Government renewable energy policy updates (NEM 3.0, FiT)
✅ Major contract wins (>RM 10M value)

LONG-TERM OUTLOOK (6-12 months):
Signal: 🔄 TURNAROUND PLAY with Re-Rating Potential

If turnaround is sustainable, TRIVE is SEVERELY undervalued:

VALUATION ANALYSIS:
Current Market Cap: RM 28.6M
Q1 FY2026 Profit: RM 2.0M
Annualized Profit (if sustained): RM 8.0M/year

Current P/E: 13.23
→ If profit is sustainable, fair P/E should be 15-20x for growth company
→ Fair market cap: RM 120M - RM 160M
→ Current RM 28.6M = 76-82% undervaluation
→ Upside potential: 319-459% (3.2x to 4.6x)

ASSET VALUE ANALYSIS:
NTA per share: RM 0.0900
Current price: RM 0.020
P/B ratio: 0.22x

→ Trading at 78% DISCOUNT to book value
→ If company continues to be profitable, P/B should re-rate to 0.6-1.0x
→ Implies fair value: RM 0.054 - RM 0.090 (170-350% upside from book value alone)

Combined Valuation Approach:
→ Earnings-based fair value: RM 0.084 - RM 0.112
→ Asset-based fair value: RM 0.054 - RM 0.090
→ Conservative target: RM 0.060-0.080 (200-300% upside)
→ Aggressive target: RM 0.100-0.120 (400-500% upside)

RISK-ADJUSTED SCENARIOS:

📈 BULL CASE (35% probability):

Risk/Reward Ratio:
→ Downside risk: 40% (to stop-loss)
→ Base case upside: 200-300%
→ Bull case upside: 400-500%
→ Risk/Reward: 1:5 to 1:12 (Attractive asymmetric bet)

INVESTMENT STRATEGY BY INVESTOR TYPE:

Conservative Investors:
→ WAIT for Q2 results confirmation
→ If Q2 is strong, take 1-2% position
→ Stop-loss mandatory

Moderate Investors:
→ Small entry now (1-2% position) at RM 0.015-0.020
→ Add on Q2 confirmation (up to 5% total)
→ Stop-loss at RM 0.012

Aggressive Investors:
→ Accumulate 3-5% position at RM 0.015-0.020
→ Scale up to 8-10% if Q2 confirms turnaround
→ Accept volatility, ride the turnaround

Traders (Swing/Short-term):
→ Buy RM 0.015-0.020, target RM 0.030 (50% quick flip)
→ Exit half at RM 0.030, let rest run with stop at breakeven

SECTION 3: PROFESSIONAL TRADER AI INSIGHTS
================================================================================

💡 INSIGHT #1: The 1,097% QoQ Surge - Project-Based Revenue Pattern
What retail investors see:
"Wow, profit increased 10x in one quarter! This stock is going to moon!"

What professionals see:
"This is project-based revenue recognition, not organic growth."

Here's the pattern:
Renewable energy companies (especially solar distributors) have lumpy revenue:
• Q1: Major solar farm project completes → RM 2.0M profit (revenue recognition)
• Q2: No major projects → RM 0.3M profit (maintenance/small contracts)
• Q3: Another project completes → RM 1.5M profit
• Q4: Slow quarter → RM 0.5M profit

Annual profit: RM 4.3M (average RM 1.1M/quarter)
But volatility is EXTREME quarter-to-quarter.

Professional interpretation:
• Q1 FY2026's RM 2.0M is likely peak quarter, not new baseline
• Expect Q2-Q4 to be lower (but hopefully still profitable)
• Annualized run-rate is probably RM 4-6M/year, not RM 8M/year
• This doesn't kill the investment case, but tempers expectations

Professional move:
Smart money will:
1. Buy NOW (before Q2 results) - if willing to accept risk
2. Or wait for Q2 results to confirm sustainable profit (safer but higher entry price)
3. Track contract announcements - new solar projects = future revenue visibility

💡 INSIGHT #2: The P/B Ratio Screaming "BUY" - 0.22x Book Value
TRIVE trades at P/B = 0.22x (RM 0.020 price vs RM 0.090 NTA)

What this means:
• Company has RM 0.09 of net assets per share
• Stock price is RM 0.02
• Buying at 22% of asset value = 78% discount

Professional analysis:
Is this a value trap or opportunity?

Check 1: What are the assets?
• Property investments + renewable energy equipment + cash
• NOT just intangible assets or goodwill
• Real assets that have tangible value

Check 2: Is the company generating positive cash flow?
• Q1 FY2026: RM 2.0M profit suggests YES
• If profitable and cash generative, assets are real

Check 3: Why is market discounting 78%?
• Historical losses (before turnaround)
• Low liquidity (hard to buy/sell large positions)
• Main Market but small cap (institutional investors ignore)
• Renewable energy sector volatility

Professional opportunity:
When P/B <0.5x AND company turns profitable, reversion to P/B 0.6-1.0x is common.

Math:
• P/B 0.6x = RM 0.054 per share (170% upside)
• P/B 0.8x = RM 0.072 per share (260% upside)
• P/B 1.0x = RM 0.090 per share (350% upside)

This creates asymmetric risk/reward independent of earnings growth.

💡 INSIGHT #3: The Renewable Energy Sector Timing - Malaysia's Green Push
TRIVE's turnaround timing coincides with Malaysia's renewable energy acceleration.

Policy backdrop (2024-2025):
• Malaysia targeting 70% renewable energy by 2050
• New Enhanced Net Energy Metering (NEM 3.0) incentives
• Corporate Green Tariff (CGT) program launched
• Large corporations mandated to increase renewable energy usage

What professionals connect:
TRIVE's Q1 FY2026 surge (Jan 2026) aligns with:
→ Corporate year-end 2025 rush to install solar (for 2026 targets)
→ NEM 3.0 incentive window deadlines
→ Government pushing solar adoption before budget cuts

This explains the 1,097% QoQ surge - it's REAL demand, not accounting tricks.

Forward-looking insight:
If policy tailwinds continue through 2026:
→ TRIVE could secure multiple RM 10-20M solar contracts
→ 2026 could be a breakout year for the entire renewable energy sector
→ Early investors (buying at RM 0.02) capture the full upside

Professionals are asking:
"Which other small-cap renewable energy plays are positioned to benefit?"
→ TRIVE is one of the smallest and most undervalued
→ Risk/reward is attractive for sector rotation play

💡 INSIGHT #4: The Liquidity Illusion - Opportunity AND Risk
Current trading volume: 14,700 shares/day (average)
At RM 0.020 = RM 294 daily turnover

What this means:
• You can buy RM 10,000 worth and move the price up 25-50%
• You can sell RM 10,000 worth and crash the price 25-50%

Professional dual interpretation:

OPPORTUNITY SIDE:
• Small amounts of buying pressure create outsized gains
• If TRIVE gets "discovered" by retail investors or influencers:
  → Volume could spike 10-50x
  → Price could gap up 100-300% in days (not weeks/months)
  → Example: If average volume increases to 500,000 shares with buy pressure,
    price could jump to RM 0.04-0.06 within a week

Risk: Momentum-based pumps are often followed by crashes

RISK SIDE:
• If you hold RM 50,000 position (2.5M shares):
  → Would take 170+ days to exit at current volume
  → You're effectively "locked in" until major news or event
• If bad news drops (Q2 results disappoint):
  → Price can gap down with no bids
  → Your stop-loss may not execute at desired price

Professional position sizing:
Never invest more than 2-3 weeks of average volume in illiquid stocks.
For TRIVE: Max RM 10,000 position for retail investor (easily exitable).

Professionals trade illiquidity like this:
→ Buy during quiet periods when nobody cares
→ Sell during volume spikes when retail FOMO kicks in
→ Never chase after price has already doubled

Right now (Dec 2025), TRIVE is in the "nobody cares" phase.
If Q2 results are strong, expect "retail FOMO" phase by May-Jun 2026.

SECTION 4: MALAYSIA-LOCALIZED ANALYSIS
================================================================================

🇲🇾 MALAYSIAN ECONOMIC CONTEXT

Malaysia's Renewable Energy Landscape (2025-2026):

Government Policy Framework:
1. **National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR)**
   → Target: 70% renewable energy capacity by 2050
   → Interim target: 40% by 2035
   → TRIVE positioned to benefit from long-term structural demand

2. **Net Energy Metering (NEM 3.0)**
   → Launched 2024, enhanced incentives for solar adoption
   → Quota: 2,000 MW allocated for 2025-2026
   → Corporate and residential segments eligible
   → TRIVE's Q1 surge likely driven by NEM 3.0 rush

3. **Corporate Green Tariff (CGT)**
   → Allows corporations to purchase renewable energy directly
   → Drives corporate solar installation demand
   → TRIVE's B2B solar projects benefit directly

4. **Large-Scale Solar (LSS) Program**
   → Government tender for utility-scale solar farms
   → While TRIVE may be too small for LSS, downstream opportunities exist
   → Component distribution and maintenance contracts

Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) Green Finance Impact:
• BNM's Climate Change and Principle-based Taxonomy (CCPT)
• Banks incentivized to lend to green energy projects
• Lower interest rates for renewable energy financing
• Easier for TRIVE's customers to finance solar installations
• Drives demand for TRIVE's products and services

Ringgit and Import Cost Dynamics:
TRIVE imports solar panels and components (likely from China):
• Weak Ringgit (USD/MYR >4.50) = Higher import costs
• Strong Ringgit (USD/MYR <4.20) = Better margins
• Current Ringgit stability helps TRIVE maintain margins
• Watch currency risk - if Ringgit weakens, margins could compress

Malaysian Corporate ESG Mandates:
• Bursa Malaysia requiring ESG reporting from listed companies
• Corporations installing solar to improve ESG scores
• TRIVE benefits from B2B corporate solar demand
• Trend accelerating through 2025-2027

🏭 LOCAL COMPETITION ANALYSIS

Malaysian Renewable Energy Sector Competitors:

Tier 1 (Large Players - Not Direct Competitors):
1. **Solarvest Holdings (0225)** - Market cap ~RM 800M
   → Dominant player in solar EPC (Engineering, Procurement, Construction)
   → TRIVE is much smaller, different market segment

2. **Cypark Resources (5184)** - Market cap ~RM 400M
   → Waste-to-energy and solar
   → More diversified than TRIVE

Tier 2 (Mid-Size - Competitors):
1. **Pekat Group (7206)** - Solar mounting systems
2. **Pestech (6254)** - Renewable energy engineering
3. **Various ACE Market renewable energy plays

TRIVE's Competitive Position:
Market Segment: Solar panel distribution + battery management systems
Scale: RM 28.6M market cap (very small)

ADVANTAGES:
✅ Nimble - can respond quickly to market opportunities
✅ Lower overhead vs large competitors
✅ Focused on distribution vs capital-intensive EPC
✅ Battery management systems (emerging high-growth segment)

DISADVANTAGES:
⚠️ Limited financial resources for large contracts
⚠️ Cannot compete with Solarvest on mega-projects
⚠️ Less brand recognition vs established players
⚠️ Higher financing costs (smaller company, higher risk)

Differentiation Strategy (Implied):
• Focus on SME and mid-market corporate customers
• Avoid bidding wars with large players on LSS projects
• Emphasize battery storage (higher margins, less competition)
• Service and maintenance (recurring revenue)

🇲🇾 MALAYSIA-SPECIFIC RISKS

1. **Subsidy and Incentive Policy Risk (HIGH)**
   Malaysia's renewable energy incentives are government-funded:
   → If government cuts NEM quotas or reduces FiT rates, demand collapses
   → 2026 budget (tabled Oct 2025) - watch for renewable energy allocation
   → Change in government priorities could derail sector
   → TRIVE's Q1 surge may be "pull-forward" demand before incentive cuts

2. **Tariff Barrier Changes (MEDIUM)**
   Solar panels imported from China face potential tariff changes:
   → If Malaysia imposes anti-dumping duties (following US/EU), costs increase
   → TRIVE's margins would be squeezed
   → However, current policy is open trade (low risk near-term)

3. **TNB (Tenaga Nasional) Grid Integration (MEDIUM)**
   Solar installations depend on TNB grid connection approvals:
   → TNB has been slow in processing solar connection applications
   → Delays in TNB approval = delays in TRIVE's project completions
   → Revenue recognition gets pushed to future quarters

4. **Foreign Worker Dependency (LOW)**
   Solar installation requires labor:
   → Malaysia's renewable energy sector uses foreign workers
   → Policy changes could increase labor costs or cause delays
   → However, TRIVE is distributor, not installer (lower exposure)

5. **Competition from Chinese Direct Sales (MEDIUM-HIGH)**
   Chinese solar manufacturers increasingly selling direct to Malaysian customers:
   → Bypasses distributors like TRIVE
   → Price competition intensifies
   → TRIVE must add value (service, financing, integration) to survive

🇲🇾 MALAYSIA-SPECIFIC OPPORTUNITIES

1. **ASEAN Power Grid Integration (Long-term)**
   ASEAN planning cross-border electricity trading:
   → Malaysia positioning as renewable energy exporter
   → Could drive massive solar farm build-out
   → TRIVE could benefit from component supply demand

2. **Industrial Sector Electrification**
   Malaysia's industrial sector (semiconductors, data centers) growing:
   → High electricity demand
   → Corporate solar adoption to offset costs and meet ESG
   → TRIVE positioned to supply industrial solar projects

3. **Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) Boom**
   TRIVE already in battery management systems:
   → BESS is next frontier in Malaysia renewable energy
   → Grid-scale storage needed for solar intermittency
   → High-growth, high-margin segment
   → TRIVE could pivot more focus here (recurring maintenance revenue)

4. **Green Financing Accessibility**
   Malaysian banks (Maybank, CIMB, PBB) offering green loans:
   → Customers can finance solar installations easily
   → Lower barrier to adoption
   → TRIVE could partner with banks (referral fees + volume)

5. **Residential Solar Boom (Emerging)**
   Malaysian middle-class increasingly installing rooftop solar:
   → Electricity tariff increases drive ROI for residential solar
   → NEM 3.0 allows residential participation
   → TRIVE could expand into B2C distribution (currently B2B focused)

🏦 MALAYSIAN INVESTOR SENTIMENT

Main Market vs ACE Market Perception:
• TRIVE is Main Market listed (not ACE)
• However, RM 28.6M market cap is smaller than many ACE stocks
• Institutional investors (EPF, KWAP, PNB) have minimum market cap thresholds
• TRIVE likely below institutional radar (market cap <RM 100M)

Retail Investor Behavior:
• Malaysian retail investors love renewable energy thematic plays
• However, TRIVE's low liquidity limits retail participation
• Price of RM 0.02 may be viewed as "cheap" (nominal price bias)
• If stock gets social media attention, could see speculative spike

Institutional Coverage:
• Unlikely any brokerage covers TRIVE (too small)
• No analyst reports available (retail must do own research)
• Institutional accumulation possible if:
  → Market cap exceeds RM 100M (needs 3-4x stock price appreciation)
  → Consistent profitability for 4+ quarters

Shariah Compliance:
• Renewable energy is generally Shariah-compliant
• TRIVE likely Shariah-compliant (need to verify)
• If yes, accessible to Islamic funds (expands investor base)

Sector Rotation Play:
• If renewable energy becomes hot sector in Malaysia:
  → Money flows to Solarvest, Cypark first (large caps)
  → Then rotates to small caps like TRIVE (higher beta)
  → TRIVE could see 2-3x appreciation just from sector momentum

• Explain TRIVE's business: Solar panel distribution + battery systems
• Malaysia's renewable energy push (NEM 3.0, NETR targets)
• "Government wants 70% renewable by 2050, TRIVE supplies the solar panels"
• Show chart: Malaysia solar installation growth trend

[4:30-6:30] THE VALUATION - Severely Undervalued?
• Market cap: RM 28.6M
• If Q1 profit is sustainable: Annualized RM 8M profit
• Current P/E: 13.23x (reasonable)
• BUT P/B ratio: 0.22x (78% discount to book value!)
• "You're buying RM 0.09 of assets for RM 0.02 - asset play + growth story"

Calculation on screen:
→ Fair P/B at 0.6x = RM 0.054 (170% upside)
→ Fair P/E at 15x = RM 0.08-0.10 (300-400% upside)

[6:30-8:30] THE RISKS - Critical Question
• Is Q1's RM 2.0M profit sustainable or one-off?
• Renewable energy revenue is lumpy (project-based)
• Q2 results will be CRITICAL test
• Low liquidity - hard to exit large positions
• Small company - one bad quarter could reverse turnaround

[8:30-10:00] THE VERDICT - Speculative Buy with Caveat
• "If you believe Malaysia's renewable energy story, TRIVE is positioned to benefit"
• "BUT wait for Q2 results to confirm sustainability"
• "Or take small position now (2-3%) with strict stop-loss"
• "This is NOT financial advice - high risk, high reward play"

[10:00-11:00] CALL TO ACTION
• "What do you think - turnaround or fluke? Comment below"
• "I'll do a Q2 results follow-up video in 3 months"
• "Subscribe to track this potential 10-bagger"

TIKTOK TEASER (60 sec):
"This RM 0.02 stock just 10X'd its profit in 1 quarter.
TRIVE (0118) - renewable energy play.
Q1 profit: RM 2.0M (up 1,097% QoQ!)
Market cap: Only RM 28.6M
If sustainable → 300-400% upside potential
BUT big question: Is Q1 a fluke or new normal?
Q2 results in 3 months will tell.
High risk, high reward. Not financial advice.

📱 CONTENT IDEA #2: "How to Find 10-Bagger Stocks BEFORE They Explode - TRIVE Case Study"

Platform: YouTube (15 min educational) + Instagram Carousel (10 slides)
Target Audience: Stock pickers, value investors, growth investors
Hook: "The 5-step framework that helps me find stocks before they 10x"

VIDEO STRUCTURE:
[0:00-1:00] HOOK
"I'm going to reverse-engineer a potential 10-bagger stock using my 5-step framework.
 The stock: TRIVE (0118). Current price: RM 0.02. Potential: RM 0.20+ (10x).
 Let me show you the exact process..."

[1:00-3:00] STEP 1: Find Turnaround Candidates
• Screen for: Losses → Profit transition
• TRIVE: ✅ Just turned profitable Q1 FY2026
• "Turnarounds are where 10-baggers come from"
• Show examples: Malaysian stocks that 10X'd after turnaround

[3:00-5:00] STEP 2: Confirm Revenue Growth Acceleration
• Not just profit, revenue must be growing
• TRIVE: ✅ Revenue +50% YoY
• "Profit without revenue growth = accounting tricks"
• "Revenue growth + margin improvement = real business recovery"

[5:00-7:00] STEP 3: Check Asset Valuation (P/B Ratio)
• Look for P/B <0.5x with improving business
• TRIVE: ✅ P/B = 0.22x (massive discount)
• "This provides downside protection"
• "Even if growth story fails, assets provide floor"

[7:00-9:00] STEP 4: Identify Sector Tailwinds
• Turnarounds work better in growing industries
• TRIVE: ✅ Renewable energy (government support, corporate ESG mandates)
• "Sector tailwinds carry all boats, small ones rise fastest"
• Chart: Malaysia renewable energy capacity growth forecast

[9:00-11:00] STEP 5: Assess Sustainability Risk
• The critical question: Is this sustainable?
• TRIVE: ⚠️ Q1 may be lumpy project-based revenue
• "This is why we wait for Q2 confirmation OR accept risk with small position"
• "Never go all-in on Step 4 - always validate Step 5"

[11:00-13:00] THE TRIVE SCORECARD
Step 1 (Turnaround): ✅ Pass
Step 2 (Revenue Growth): ✅ Pass
Step 3 (Asset Value): ✅ Pass
Step 4 (Sector Tailwind): ✅ Pass
Step 5 (Sustainability): ⚠️ Unknown (need Q2 data)

Score: 4/5 → Qualifies as potential 10-bagger candidate

[13:00-14:30] ACTION PLAN
• Option A: Wait for Q2 results (safer, but higher entry price if confirmed)
• Option B: Small position now 2-3% (higher risk, better entry price)
• Stop-loss: RM 0.012 (below 52-week low)
• Target: RM 0.08-0.12 (4-6x) over 12-18 months if turnaround real

constitute financial advice, investment recommendation, or solicitation to buy
or sell securities. The information presented is based on publicly available
data and may contain errors or omissions.

TRIVE Property Group Berhad (0118) is a turnaround situation with significant
execution risk. The sustainability of Q1 FY2026 results is unconfirmed and
subject to quarterly volatility due to project-based revenue. Investment in
this security carries substantial risk including possible loss of principal.

The renewable energy sector in Malaysia is subject to government policy changes,
regulatory risks, and technological disruption. Sector tailwinds discussed may
not materialize as projected.

Liquidity risk is significant given low trading volumes. Investors may face
difficulty exiting positions during adverse market conditions. Price volatility
is expected to remain high.

Readers must conduct their own due diligence, consult with licensed financial
advisors, and carefully read the company's annual reports, quarterly reports,
and Bursa Malaysia announcements before making any investment decisions.

All projections, price targets, and scenarios presented are speculative
estimates based on assumptions that may not materialize. Q2 FY2026 results
will be critical in validating or invalidating the turnaround thesis.

Investment decisions are solely the responsibility of individual investors.
