Report Date: 2025-12-12
Analysis Period: Q2 FY2025 (Quarter ended 31-Jul-2025)
Category: Revenue DOWN, Profit DOWN (YoY)
================================================================================

SECTION 1: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY
================================================================================

Latest Quarter Performance (Q2 FY2025 ending 31-Jul-2025):
-----------------------------------------------------------
Revenue:        RM 1.4 billion
Net Profit:     RM 101 million

Year-over-Year Comparison (Q2 FY2024 ending 31-Jul-2024):
----------------------------------------------------------
Revenue:        RM 2.1 billion  →  -33.3% decline
Net Profit:     RM 203 million  →  -50.2% decline

Key Observations:
-----------------
• Both revenue and profit declined significantly YoY
• Revenue dropped by one-third, falling from RM 2.1B to RM 1.4B
• Profit margin compression: Profit fell faster (-50.2%) than revenue (-33.3%)
• This indicates operational challenges beyond just revenue decline
• Q2 FY2025 represents a challenging period following multiple FPSOs achieving
  first oil in late 2024

Financial Health Indicators:
----------------------------
• The company's order book remains strong at USD 19 billion through 2048
• Three major FPSOs achieved first oil: FPSO Maria Quitéria (Oct 2024),
  FPSO Atlanta (Dec 2024), and FPSO Agogo (Feb 2025)
• Estimated annual cash flow of USD 850-900 million expected from current
  operating fleet (significant increase from USD 300M in 9M FY2024)
• Market cap: USD 1.68 billion (as of Oct 2025)
• Current fleet: 11 vessels (10 FPSOs + 1 FSO)

================================================================================
SECTION 2: REASONS FOR DECLINE
================================================================================

1. Timing Issues - Pre-Revenue Recognition Phase:
--------------------------------------------------
The Q2 FY2025 decline appears to be a transitional period before major revenue
contributors come online:

• FPSO Maria Quitéria achieved first oil in October 2024 (after Q2 ended)
• FPSO Atlanta achieved first oil in December 2024 (after Q2 ended)
• FPSO Agogo completed in February 2025 and began operations
• These three vessels have combined contract backlogs of USD 12.4 billion:
  - FPSO Maria Quitéria: USD 5.1 billion
  - FPSO Agogo: USD 5.3 billion (15-year contract with 5-year extension option)
  - FPSO Atlanta: USD 2.1 billion

2. Revenue Recognition Delays:
-------------------------------
• FPSO construction and commissioning phases generate lower revenues than
  operational lease revenues
• The gap between project completion and full revenue recognition can create
  temporary earnings dips
• FY2025 Q2 caught the company between construction phase revenues and
  operational lease revenues

3. Project Transition Costs:
-----------------------------
• Mobilization and commissioning expenses for new FPSOs reduce profitability
• FPSO Agogo completion (3 months ahead of schedule) likely incurred
  accelerated costs in Q2
• Integration of new vessels into operational fleet requires upfront investments

4. Operational Efficiency Challenges:
--------------------------------------
• Profit declined faster (-50.2%) than revenue (-33.3%), suggesting:
  - Higher operating costs during transition period
  - Lower-margin construction revenues vs. operational lease revenues
  - Possible cost overruns or inefficiencies during project execution

5. Industry Dynamics:
---------------------
• Global FPSO market facing shipyard capacity constraints, extending
  construction periods
• Limited shipyard capacity creates scheduling pressures and potential delays
• Competition from 60 FPSO projects expected between 2025-2029 (USD 91B total)

6. Market Position Adjustment:
-------------------------------
• Yinson is world's 2nd/3rd largest FPSO operator (behind SBM Offshore,
  competing with Modec)
• Industry consolidation from 40 players to handful creates competitive pricing
• Long contract lead times (15-25 years) mean current earnings reflect contracts
  signed years ago

• South America (Brazil pre-salt): 35% of projects
• Africa (Nigeria, Angola): 28% of projects
• Middle East (Saudi, UAE): 22% of projects
• Asia-Pacific: 15% of projects

Investment Thesis:
"Pick of shovels" play - regardless of which oil fields succeed, FPSOs needed


📹 Video 8: "Why Middle East Oil Spending is Jumping from USD 33B to USD 41B"
Platform: YouTube, Instagram
Duration: 8-10 minutes
Geopolitical + Investment angle

Narrative:
1. Middle East traditionally land-based oil production
2. Offshore expansion = new mega-projects (Saudi, UAE, Qatar)
3. YINSON's positioning in Middle East market
4. Geopolitical stability premium (diversification from African risk)
5. How this affects YINSON's growth prospects

Timely Hook: Tie to current news about Middle East energy developments

Investment Angle:
"Malaysia company benefiting from Middle East energy boom"


📹 Video 9: "The Shipyard Shortage Creating a FPSO Supply Crisis"
Platform: YouTube
Duration: 10-12 minutes
Supply/Demand Economics

Teach Economic Concept:
Supply constraint + stable demand = pricing power

Explain:
1. FPSOs need specialized shipyards
2. Limited global capacity (mostly China, Singapore, South Korea)
3. Construction time: 3-5 years per FPSO
4. 60 projects needed, but capacity for ~11 per year
5. How this affects: (a) project timelines, (b) pricing, (c) competitive moat

YINSON Advantage:
• Established relationships with COSCO, Seatrium
• FPSO Agogo completed 3 months EARLY
• Track record = priority access to shipyard capacity

Value Investing Angle:
"Sometimes the best moat is physical infrastructure constraints"


Pillar 4: "Myth-Busting" Series - Address Objections
-----------------------------------------------------

📹 Video 10: "'Oil is Dead' - Then Why Did Billionaires Just Invest USD 1B?"
Platform: TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts
Duration: 60-90 seconds
Angle: Provocative contrarian take

Hook: "If oil is dying, someone forgot to tell Abu Dhabi Investment Authority..."

Fast-Paced Script:
• MYTH: Oil demand will crash by 2030
• REALITY: IEA forecasts peak demand 2030-2035 (not disappearance)
• MATH: YINSON's FPSO contracts extend to 2048
• BRIDGE: Oil cash flows fund renewable transition (557 MW solar/wind operating)
• CONCLUSION: "Best positioned companies profit from BOTH sides of transition"

Engagement: "Oil bulls vs Green bulls - fight it out in comments"


📹 Video 11: "Can Malaysia Compete in Global Energy Infrastructure?"
Platform: YouTube, LinkedIn
Duration: 10-12 minutes
National pride + investment case

Address Skepticism: "Is YINSON just a local player punching above weight?"

Counter-Arguments:
1. YINSON = 2nd/3rd largest FPSO operator GLOBALLY
2. Operating in 11 countries across 4 continents
3. Competing against: SBM (Netherlands), Modec (Japan), BW (Singapore)
4. Recent wins: Angola (USD 5.3B), Brazil, Vietnam
5. International investor validation (ADIA, BC Investment)

Emotional Angle:
"Malaysian company dominating global energy infrastructure" (national pride)

Data Visualization:
• World map showing YINSON's 11-country operations
• Fleet comparison: YINSON 11 vessels vs competitors
• Contract value comparison


📹 Video 12: "Why I'm NOT Worried About Energy Transition (YINSON Analysis)"
Platform: YouTube
Duration: 12-15 minutes
Address biggest bear thesis

Acknowledge Fear: "Yes, world moving to renewables. Here's why YINSON still wins:"

Arguments:
1. Timeline Mismatch:
   - Energy transition = 20-30 year process
   - YINSON's FPSO contracts = 15-25 years (aligned with transition)
   - By 2048, renewable portfolio should offset declining O&G

2. Dual Revenue Model:
   - USD 19B FPSO backlog (secure cash flows)
   - 1.5 GW renewable pipeline (growth engine)
   - O&G profits fund renewable expansion (smart capital allocation)

3. "Last Man Standing" Thesis:
   - Many pure-play O&G companies will fail
   - Diversified players like YINSON survive + acquire distressed assets cheap

4. Zero Emissions FPSO:
   - Technology leadership in "cleaner oil" production
   - Extends relevance during transition period

Honest Assessment:
"Risk? Absolutely. But 10-year horizon + diversification = manageable risk"

--------------------------------------------------------------

📹 Video 13: "How I'd Invest RM10,000 in YINSON (Recovery Play Strategy)"
Platform: YouTube, TikTok
Duration: 8-10 minutes (YT), 60 sec (TikTok)
Angle: Tactical investment guide

Strategy Breakdown:

Option 1: Conservative (Low Risk Tolerance)
• Wait for Q3/Q4 FY2025 results (confirm 3 FPSOs contributing revenue)
• Entry only if operational cash flow confirms USD 850-900M guidance
• Position size: 3-5% of portfolio
• Timeline: 2-3 year hold

Option 2: Moderate (Medium Risk Tolerance)
• Dollar-cost average over 3 months (RM3,333/month)
• Captures any further dips while building position
• Position size: 5-8% of portfolio
• Timeline: 3-5 year hold

Option 3: Aggressive (High Risk Tolerance)
• Full position now at "maximum fear" moment (Q2 decline)
• Betting on Q3/Q4 recovery surprise
• Position size: 8-10% of portfolio
• Add more if drops below RM X.XX (calculate support level)
• Timeline: 5+ year hold (include renewable upside)

Risk Management:
• Stop-loss if: USD 1B investment deal falls through, contract cancellations,
  oil price <USD 50
• Take profit trigger: Stock reaches USD 19B order book fair valuation

Disclaimer: "Not financial advice, just how I'd approach it personally"

📹 Video 15: "The 'Barbell Strategy': YINSON + Renewable Pure-Play"
Platform: YouTube, LinkedIn
Duration: 10-12 minutes
Advanced portfolio construction

Concept: Diversified energy transition exposure

Barbell Strategy:
Side 1: YINSON (O&G cash flows + renewable growth)
Side 2: Pure renewable company (solar/wind developer)

Rationale:
• If energy transition slower than expected → YINSON's O&G profits
• If energy transition faster than expected → Renewable pure-play outperforms
• YINSON provides "middle path" exposure

Example Allocation:
• 60% YINSON (core position)
• 40% Pure renewable ETF or stock
• Rebalance annually based on energy transition progress

Risk/Reward Profile:
• Lower volatility than pure O&G or pure renewable
• Captures upside from both scenarios
• YINSON's dual model provides downside protection

Target Audience: Sophisticated retail investors
