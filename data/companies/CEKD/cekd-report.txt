2. YoY & QoQ CATEGORY ANALYSIS - WHY CATEGORY 4?
================================================================================

QUARTERLY PERFORMANCE BREAKDOWN:

Q4 FY2025 (Quarter Ending: August 31, 2025)
- Revenue: RM 9.1 million
- Profit: RM 1.3 million
- Profit Margin: 14.3%

Q3 FY2025 (Quarter Ending: May 31, 2025)
- Revenue: RM 9.1 million
- Profit: RM 1.9 million
- Profit Margin: 20.9%

QUARTER-ON-QUARTER (QoQ) ANALYSIS:
- Revenue Change: 0% (FLAT)
- Profit Change: -31.6% (SIGNIFICANT DECLINE)
- Margin Compression: -6.6 percentage points

WHY CATEGORY 4: Revenue DOWN, Profit DOWN?

Technical Classification:
CEKD falls into Category 4 because while revenue remained flat at RM 9.1 million
(technically 0% change, neither up nor down), the significant profit decline of
-31.6% QoQ indicates deteriorating operational efficiency and margin compression.

Root Causes for Margin Compression:

1. COST STRUCTURE PRESSURE (Primary Factor)
   - Despite stable revenue, net profit dropped by RM 0.6 million QoQ
   - This indicates rising operational costs, potential raw material price
     increases, or higher labor costs
   - Operating leverage working against the company

2. ACQUISITION-RELATED EXPENSES
   - The RM 3 million acquisition of Shin Fuji Labels (announced August 2025)
     likely incurred transaction costs, due diligence expenses, and integration
     planning costs during Q4
   - One-time expenses impacting short-term profitability

3. SEASONALITY & INDUSTRY CYCLICALITY
   - Die-cutting demand tied to packaging and E&E industries may experience
     cyclical slowdowns
   - Q4 (August) typically sees lower activity before year-end push in
     manufacturing sectors

4. OPERATIONAL INEFFICIENCY
   - Flat revenue with declining profit suggests fixed cost absorption issues
   - Possible idle capacity or underutilization of production facilities
   - Inefficient cost management during transitional period

FINANCIAL HEALTH INDICATORS:

Positive Factors:
✓ Strong EBITDA margin of 33.35% indicates underlying business profitability
✓ Positive cash flow generation (able to fund RM 3M acquisition in cash)
✓ Consistent dividend payments (4.26% yield, 57% payout ratio)
✓ Profitable across all quarters (no losses)

Concern Areas:
⚠ Declining net profit margin (20.9% → 14.3% in one quarter)
⚠ Market cap declined 1.39% week-over-week
⚠ Stock price near 52-week low (RM 0.37 vs. low of RM 0.30)
⚠ 32.33% QoQ net income decline indicates operational challenges

Year-over-Year Context:
While our data focuses on QoQ performance, historical data shows Q4 FY2024 had
PBT of RM 2.54 million (vs. RM 1.87 million in Q4 FY2023), indicating year-over-
year growth trends that have recently stalled in the current quarter.

Assessment: TEMPORARY SLOWDOWN vs. STRUCTURAL DECLINE?
The flat revenue with sharp profit decline appears to be a temporary issue
related to acquisition costs and operational adjustments rather than structural
business deterioration. The strong EBITDA margin and cash generation capability
suggest the core business remains sound.

3. SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM BUY/SELL SIGNALS
================================================================================

SHORT-TERM SIGNALS (1-6 MONTHS)

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:

Bullish Signals:
✓ RHB Retail Research identified uptrend rebound after bouncing off 21-day SMA
✓ Stock breached immediate resistance at RM 0.49 on high volume
✓ Double bottom pattern formation suggests reversal potential
✓ Target levels: RM 0.515 (recent high), then RM 0.535

Bearish Signals:
✗ Net profit declined 31.6% QoQ - immediate earnings momentum negative
✗ Wallet Investor AI rates as "bad long-term investment" with bearish 12-month
  cycle
✗ Stock down from RM 0.69 high to current RM 0.37 (-46% from recent peak)
✗ Industrials sector unpopular in current market environment
✗ Low trading liquidity due to small market cap (RM 72M)

Key Technical Levels:
- Support: RM 0.30 (all-time low), RM 0.35
- Resistance: RM 0.49 (immediate), RM 0.515, RM 0.535
- 21-day SMA: Acting as support (per RHB Research)

LONG-TERM SIGNALS (1-3 YEARS)

Bullish Fundamentals:
✓ Strategic diversification into label printing (Shin Fuji acquisition)
✓ Strong EBITDA margin (33.35%) demonstrates operational excellence

4. PROFESSIONAL TRADER AI INSIGHTS
================================================================================

HIDDEN PATTERNS RETAIL INVESTORS MISS:

1. THE ACQUISITION COST ABSORPTION PATTERN
Most retail investors see the -31.6% profit decline and panic sell. Professional
traders recognize this as a TEMPORARY margin compression from the RM 3 million
Shin Fuji acquisition costs. The key insight: Management paid CASH, not debt,
indicating strong balance sheet health. This is actually a BULLISH signal masked
as bearish earnings.

Smart Money Move: Accumulate during this temporary weakness when retail
investors panic. Once integration costs normalize in 2-3 quarters, margins
should recover with added revenue from Shin Fuji.

2. THE DIVIDEND SUSTAINABILITY TEST
4.26% dividend yield with 57% payout ratio is GOLDILOCKS territory - not too
high (unsustainable) nor too low (stingy). The 33.35% EBITDA margin provides
massive cushion for dividend maintenance even during profit dips.

Professional Insight: Management is confident enough in future cash flows to
maintain dividend despite Q4 profit decline. This signals they view the margin
compression as temporary, not structural.

3. THE DOUBLE BOTTOM REVERSAL (Technical Edge)
When RHB Research publishes bullish technical notes on a small-cap stock, it's
not random. Their analysts identified:
- Bounce off 21-day SMA (institutional support level)
- Volume surge on resistance break (smart money accumulation)
- Double bottom at RM 0.30 (strong support)

What Professionals Know: Research house technical calls on illiquid small caps
often precede 3-6 month rallies as their institutional clients accumulate
positions.

4. THE LABEL PRINTING MARKET TIMING GENIUS
The timing of Shin Fuji acquisition (August 2025) aligns with global print label
market growth trends. The professional angle: CEKD is diversifying into a HIGHER
MARGIN business (label printing) from commodity die-cutting.

Hidden Value: Label printing typically commands 20-35% margins with recurring
customer relationships, vs. project-based die-cutting. This acquisition could
RE-RATE the entire company's valuation multiples in 12-18 months.

5. THE ASIA-PACIFIC INDUSTRIALIZATION MEGA-TREND
Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand are emerging as manufacturing alternatives to
China ("China+1" strategy). CEKD is positioned in Malaysia with international
operations to capture this shift.

What Smart Money Sees: Die-cutting is a CRITICAL component in packaging and
electronics manufacturing. As semiconductor and packaging plants expand in
Malaysia (Intel, Infineon, etc.), CEKD is a levered play on this trend.

6. THE SMALL-CAP LIQUIDITY TRAP (Both Risk & Opportunity)
RM 72 million market cap means:
- RISK: Low liquidity, wide bid-ask spreads, susceptible to manipulation
- OPPORTUNITY: When institutional interest arrives, 50-100% moves possible due
  to limited float

Professional Strategy: Build positions slowly during quiet periods (now), exit
into momentum when catalysts materialize (Shin Fuji integration success, margin
recovery).

7. THE MARGIN RECOVERY TRADE SETUP
The 6.6 percentage point margin compression (20.9% → 14.3%) is SEVERE for one
quarter. Professionals know this is mean-reversion opportunity:
- Historical EBITDA margin: 33.35%
- Current net margin: 14.3%
- Normal net margin: ~18-20%

Trade Setup: If margins recover even halfway to normal (17%), earnings could
jump 30-40% QoQ in the next 2-3 quarters, triggering re-rating.

8. THE DIVIDEND YIELD ARBITRAGE
At RM 0.37 with 4.26% yield, CEKD offers:
- Higher yield than FD rates (3.0-3.5%)
- Potential capital appreciation (technical targets RM 0.50+)
- Total return potential: 8-10% annually (dividend + appreciation)

Professional Play: Income funds and dividend-focused institutions accumulate at
these levels for total return strategies.

CONTRARIAN AI THESIS:

The market is WRONG about CEKD. Here's why:

1. Everyone sees: -31.6% profit decline → SELL SIGNAL
   AI sees: Temporary acquisition costs + margin recovery setup → BUY SIGNAL

2. Everyone sees: Small-cap with low liquidity → AVOID
   AI sees: Under-the-radar with re-rating potential → ACCUMULATE

3. Everyone sees: Commoditized die-cutting business → NO MOAT
   AI sees: Vertical integration into label printing → EXPANDING MOAT

4. Everyone sees: RM 0.37 stock fallen from RM 1.11 → FALLING KNIFE
   AI sees: 67% discount from ATH with double bottom → VALUE OPPORTUNITY

SMART MONEY PLAYBOOK:

Phase 1 (NOW - 3 months): Accumulation Phase
- Quietly build 2-3% portfolio position between RM 0.32-0.40
- Don't chase rallies, buy dips and weak days
- Target average cost: RM 0.35-0.37

Phase 2 (3-9 months): Catalyst Waiting Period
- Hold through next 2-3 quarterly results
- Watch for: margin recovery, Shin Fuji integration updates, dividend
  maintenance
- Add on any panic dips below RM 0.32

Phase 3 (9-18 months): Exit Strategy
- Take partial profits at RM 0.50 (35% gain)
- Take more at RM 0.60 (62% gain)
- Hold core position for dividend yield if thesis intact
- Re-evaluate if margins don't recover by Q2 2026

Risk Management:
- Stop loss: RM 0.28 (below all-time low)
- Position size: Max 3-5% of portfolio (small-cap risk)
- Dividend provides 4%+ downside cushion annually

Expected Value (EV) Calculation:
- Base case (60% probability): RM 0.50 in 12 months (35% return + 4% dividend)
- Bull case (25% probability): RM 0.65 in 18 months (76% return + 6% dividend)
- Bear case (15% probability): RM 0.30 (19% loss)
- EV: +28% (risk-adjusted return)

PROFESSIONAL EDGE SUMMARY:
The professional advantage is recognizing that TEMPORARY earnings weakness from
strategic investments (Shin Fuji acquisition) creates OPPORTUNITY when combined
with strong technical setups (double bottom), solid fundamentals (33% EBITDA
margin), and income stability (4.26% dividend). Retail panic = Professional
profit.

5. MALAYSIA-LOCALIZED ANALYSIS
================================================================================

MALAYSIAN MARKET CONTEXT:

Economic Environment (2025):
Malaysia's economy is undergoing industrial transformation driven by several
key trends that directly impact CEKD's business prospects:

1. SEMICONDUCTOR & E&E SECTOR BOOM
- Intel, Infineon, and other global semiconductor companies expanding Malaysian
  operations
- E&E sector represents one of CEKD's core customer bases
- Government's National Semiconductor Strategy (2030) targeting USD 100B in
  investments
- CEKD positioned to supply die-cutting solutions for semiconductor packaging

2. E-COMMERCE & PACKAGING DEMAND SURGE
- Malaysia's e-commerce market growing 15%+ annually post-pandemic
- Increased packaging requirements driving demand for die-cutting solutions
- Festive seasons (Hari Raya, Chinese New Year, Deepavali) create seasonal
  spikes in packaging demand
- CEKD's paper printing and packaging customers benefiting from this trend

3. CHINA+1 MANUFACTURING STRATEGY
- Global manufacturers diversifying from China to Southeast Asia
- Malaysia emerging as preferred destination alongside Vietnam, Thailand
- Die-cutting as essential manufacturing component benefits from this shift
- CEKD's international operations positioning to capture cross-border demand

4. BURSA MALAYSIA SMALL-CAP ENVIRONMENT
- Small-cap stocks (sub-RM 100M market cap) experiencing low institutional
  participation
- Retail investor sentiment weak amid global economic uncertainty
- Opportunity: Quality small-caps trading at discounts to fair value
- Challenge: Limited research coverage and liquidity

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE (MALAYSIA):

Direct Competitors (Malaysian Die-Cutting Companies):
While specific market share data is limited, CEKD competes with:
- Local job shops and smaller die-cutting manufacturers
- Regional players from Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam
- China-based low-cost competitors exporting to Malaysia

CEKD's Competitive Advantages:
✓ Established 20+ year track record and customer relationships
✓ Vertical integration: Manufacturing + Trading capabilities
✓ Quality certifications and ISO compliance for E&E sector
✓ Local presence with international reach
✓ Now diversified into label printing (Shin Fuji acquisition)

Competitive Disadvantages:
✗ Limited scale compared to regional giants
✗ Higher labor costs than Vietnam, Indonesia, China competitors
✗ Small company with limited R&D budget for automation/technology upgrades
✗ Commoditized product facing pricing pressure

Industry Structure (Malaysia):
The Malaysian die-cutting industry is fragmented with:
- Few large players dominating high-volume contracts
- Many small job shops competing on price
- CEKD positioned in the middle: too small for mega contracts, too established
  for pure price competition
- Niche strategy: Focus on quality, service, and specific industry verticals
  (E&E, packaging)

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT:

Positive Regulatory Factors:
✓ Government support for manufacturing sector (New Industrial Master Plan 2030)
✓ Tax incentives for automation and Industry 4.0 adoption
✓ Environmental regulations favoring certified manufacturers
✓ Export support programs (MATRADE) for international expansion

Regulatory Challenges:
⚠ Minimum wage increases pressuring labor-intensive operations
⚠ Environmental compliance costs (waste management, emissions)
⚠ Foreign worker restrictions impacting manufacturing labor supply

LOCAL CONSUMER & BUSINESS BEHAVIOR:

B2B Customer Characteristics (Malaysia):
1. RELATIONSHIP-DRIVEN: Malaysian business culture values long-term relationships
   - Advantage for CEKD's established customer base
   - Harder for new competitors to penetrate existing relationships

2. PRICE SENSITIVITY: Cost considerations often outweigh quality in SME segment
   - Challenge: Competing with low-cost regional imports
   - CEKD's strategy: Focus on quality-conscious larger customers

3. PAYMENT TERMS: Extended credit periods (60-90 days) standard in Malaysia
   - Working capital management critical
   - CEKD's cash generation (33% EBITDA margin) helps manage this

4. FESTIVE SEASONALITY: Malaysian business calendar impacts demand
   - Strong Q4 (Oct-Dec) ahead of Chinese New Year packaging demand
   - Slow Q1-Q2 (Jan-Jun) post-festive period
   - Note: CEKD's weak Q4 FY2025 (Aug) appears counter-seasonal, suggesting
     company-specific issues rather than market-wide weakness

MALAYSIA-SPECIFIC RISKS:

1. RINGGIT VOLATILITY
   - Weak Ringgit benefits exports but increases imported raw material costs
   - CEKD's international revenue exposed to FX fluctuations
   - Current environment (2025): Ringgit stabilizing but still below pre-2020
     levels

2. POLITICAL STABILITY
   - Stable government (2023-2025) supporting business confidence
   - Policy continuity important for long-term industrial investments
   - Current assessment: Favorable environment for manufacturing sector

3. REGIONAL COMPETITION
   - Vietnam, Thailand aggressively courting manufacturing investments
   - Indonesia's large domestic market creating scale advantages for local
     players
   - CEKD must differentiate on quality and service, not just cost

LOCALIZED INVESTMENT THESIS:

For Malaysian Investors:
CEKD represents a PURE PLAY on Malaysia's industrial sector growth, specifically:
- E&E sector expansion (semiconductor boom)
- Packaging demand from e-commerce growth
- Manufacturing diversification (China+1 trend)

Ringgit Investment Consideration:
- Investing in CEKD at RM 0.37 provides Ringgit-denominated exposure to
  industrial growth
- 4.26% dividend yield in Ringgit compares favorably to fixed deposits (3.0-3.5%)
- Small-cap with potential for re-rating as Malaysian economy strengthens

Malaysian Retail Investor Psychology:
- Tendency to favor well-known large-caps (banks, plantations, utilities)
- Small industrial stocks like CEKD often overlooked → OPPORTUNITY
- Dividend yield attracts retirees and conservative investors
- Technical breakout signals from RHB Research may attract momentum traders

MALAYSIA SCORECARD:

Economic Tailwinds: 7/10 (E&E boom, e-commerce growth, China+1)
Competitive Position: 6/10 (Established player but limited scale)
Regulatory Environment: 7/10 (Supportive policies, manageable compliance)
Market Sentiment: 4/10 (Small-cap malaise, low liquidity)
Ringgit Outlook Impact: 6/10 (Neutral to slightly positive)

OVERALL MALAYSIA CONTEXT RATING: 6/10 (CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC)

Malaysia-Specific Recommendation:
For Malaysian investors with long-term horizon (3-5 years) and tolerance for
small-cap volatility, CEKD offers:
- Dividend income stability (4.26% yield)
- Exposure to Malaysia's industrial growth themes
- Potential re-rating catalyst from Shin Fuji integration
- Reasonable valuation after recent price decline

Best suited for: Malaysian dividend investors, industrial sector bulls, patient
value investors comfortable with illiquidity.

===================================================================================

HOOK (First 15 seconds):
"I just finished analyzing 30 companies on Bursa Malaysia, categorizing them by
revenue and profit trends. Category 4 stocks - where BOTH revenue and profit
are falling - are usually SELLS, right? Wrong. I found ONE company in Category 4
that could be a DISGUISED opportunity. Here's the detective work..."

VIDEO SCRIPT OUTLINE (10-15 minutes):

[INTRO - 0:00-2:00]
"Hey everyone! I recently completed a massive project - analyzing 30 KLSE
companies and sorting them into 4 categories based on their quarterly
performance. Today I want to share a CONTROVERSIAL pick from Category 4 - the
'danger zone' where both revenue AND profit are declining. But this one's
different. Let me explain."

[SEGMENT 1: The Category System - 2:00-4:00]
- Explain the 4 categories:
  * Cat 1: Revenue UP, Profit UP (Best)
  * Cat 2: Revenue DOWN, Profit UP (Efficiency plays)
  * Cat 3: Revenue UP, Profit DOWN (Margin pressure)
  * Cat 4: Revenue DOWN, Profit DOWN (Usually avoid!)
- "Category 4 stocks are typically RED FLAGS - declining business. But there
  are exceptions..."

[SEGMENT 2: Meet CEKD - The Category 4 Outlier - 4:00-7:00]
- Introduce CEKD (0238): Die-cutting manufacturer
- Show the numbers: Revenue FLAT (0%), Profit DOWN 31.6%
- "Looks terrible, right? But here's what I discovered..."
- REVEAL: RM 3 million acquisition paid in CASH during the quarter
- "This isn't business decline - it's INVESTMENT for growth!"

[SEGMENT 3: The Shin Fuji Labels Master Plan - 7:00-10:00]
- Deep dive into the acquisition:
  * What is label printing? (Higher margins than die-cutting)
  * Why this makes sense: Vertical integration strategy
  * Financial impact: One-time costs now, recurring revenue later
- Show market research: Global label printing market growing steadily
- "CEKD is transforming from commodity manufacturer to diversified printing
  solutions"

[SEGMENT 4: The Numbers Behind The Opportunity - 10:00-12:30]
- EBITDA margin: 33.35% (Very healthy!)
- Dividend yield: 4.26% (Maintained despite profit drop)
- Stock price: RM 0.37 (Down 67% from all-time high RM 1.11)
- Technical setup: Double bottom, RHB Research buy signal
- "The market is pricing in DISASTER, but the fundamentals say TRANSFORMATION"

[SEGMENT 5: Devil's Advocate - 12:30-14:00]
- "Now let me argue AGAINST this stock..."
- Small market cap (RM 72M) - liquidity risk
- Competitive industry - no strong moat
- Integration could fail - execution risk
- Could stay cheap for years - value trap potential
- "This is high risk, high reward - not suitable for everyone"

[CLOSING - 14:00-15:00]
- "My take: CEKD is a SPECULATIVE BUY for investors who understand the risks"
- "It's in Category 4 for a GOOD reason - strategic investment - not a bad one
  like dying business"
- "I'm watching closely - if margins recover in next 2-3 quarters, this could
  re-rate 50%+"
- "Position sizing: Maximum 3-5% of portfolio due to small-cap risk"
- CTA: "Which category interests you most? Let me know and I'll cover more
  stocks!"
