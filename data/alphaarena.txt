================================================================================
1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

AlphaArena (by Nof1.ai) is a competitive AI trading platform where multiple
Large Language Models (LLMs) compete against each other in REAL market trading.
The platform runs seasonal competitions (~2 weeks each) with transparent,
verifiable trade execution.

KEY DIFFERENTIATOR: Real money, real markets, real consequences.
- $10,000 starting capital per AI per mode
- Trades executed on actual exchanges (Hyperliquid for crypto, live brokers for stocks)
- All trades are 100% verifiable (on-chain for crypto, account statements for stocks)

================================================================================
2. PLATFORM OVERVIEW
================================================================================

WHAT IT IS:
- A "gladiator arena" for AI trading models
- Multiple AI models compete simultaneously
- Real-time market execution (not simulation)
- Transparent decision-making visible to users

WHAT IT PROVES:
- Which AI models are actually good at trading
- How different AI architectures approach financial decisions
- The impact of different constraints (leverage, risk management) on AI performance

BUSINESS MODEL (Inferred):
- Attracts attention to AI capabilities
- Provides real-world benchmarks for LLM performance
- Creates engagement through competition narratives
- Potentially monetizable through subscriptions, data access, or partnerships

================================================================================
3. COMPETITION STRUCTURE
================================================================================

SEASONAL FORMAT:
- Duration: ~2 weeks per season
- Example: Season 1.5 ran mid-November to December 3, 2025
- Models continue trading after season ends (perpetual mode)

CAPITAL ALLOCATION:
- Each AI receives $10,000 starting capital
- Capital is PER MODE (so each AI manages 4 separate $10K portfolios)
- Total exposure per AI: $40,000 across all modes

MARKETS TRADED:
- Crypto: Via Hyperliquid (decentralized perpetuals exchange)
- Stocks: Via live brokerage accounts (US equities)
- Appears to focus on liquid, high-volume assets

SCORING:
- Performance measured by portfolio return %
- Aggregate Index = average across all 4 modes
- Winner = model with best aggregate or most modes won
- Season 1.5 winner: GROK 4.20 (won by making money in ALL 4 modes)

================================================================================
4. AI MODELS & PARTICIPATION
================================================================================

SEASON 1.5 PARTICIPANTS:
1. GPT-5.1 (OpenAI)
2. Grok-4.20 (xAI) - WINNER
3. Claude-Sonnet-4.5 (Anthropic)
4. DeepSeek-Chat-V3.1 (DeepSeek)
5. Gemini-3-Pro (Google)
6. Qwen3-Max (Alibaba)
7. Kimi-K2-Thinking (Moonshot AI)
8. Mystery Model (Unknown)

OBSERVATION: They use latest model versions, not base models.
This is important - they're testing FRONTIER AI capabilities.

FOR MAD2ARENA:
Our planned participants:
- Claude (Anthropic)
- GPT-4 (OpenAI)
- DeepSeek
- Gemini (Google)
- Grok (xAI)

We have 5 models vs their 8. This is manageable for initial launch.

================================================================================
5. TRADING MODES (KEY INNOVATION)
================================================================================

This is AlphaArena's MOST INNOVATIVE FEATURE. Each AI trades in 4 DIFFERENT
modes simultaneously, testing different aspects of trading intelligence:

MODE 1: NEW BASELINE
--------------------
- Full access to market news and data
- Memory enabled (can learn from past trades)
- Reflexive self-improvement allowed
- This is the "standard" trading mode

MODE 2: MONK MODE
-----------------
- Emphasis on CAPITAL PRESERVATION
- More effective risk management required
- Lower risk tolerance, defensive trading
- Tests: Can AI protect capital during volatility?

MODE 3: SITUATIONAL AWARENESS
-----------------------------
- AI can see OTHER models' results and rankings
- Competitive intelligence enabled
- Tests: Does knowing competitors' performance change behavior?
- Fascinating insight: Does AI get aggressive when losing? Conservative when winning?

MODE 4: MAX LEVERAGE
--------------------
- REQUIRED to use high leverage (up to 20x)
- Every trade must be leveraged
- High risk, high reward mode
- Tests: Can AI manage extreme risk?

WHY THIS MATTERS:
-----------------
The multi-mode system creates RICH comparative data:
- Same AI, different constraints = reveals true capabilities
- Isolates specific trading skills (risk mgmt, aggression, adaptation)
- Creates multiple narratives per season (who's best at what?)

FOR MAD2ARENA CONSIDERATION:
----------------------------
We could implement similar modes for KLSE:
- Standard Mode: Normal trading
- Defensive Mode: Max 5% per position, stop-loss required
- Aggressive Mode: Can use margin/leverage
- News-Reactive Mode: Must trade based on news events

================================================================================
6. AI TRADING BEHAVIORS & STRATEGIES OBSERVED
================================================================================

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS DOMINANCE:
- Most models use Moving Averages and MACD
- Momentum and trend-following are primary strategies
- Very few contrarian or mean-reversion approaches observed

MODEL-SPECIFIC BEHAVIORS:

DeepSeek:
- Trend-following, long-biased
- Notable win: Long XRP at $2.29, closed at $2.45
- Willing to hold positions through volatility

Gemini:
- High-frequency trading approach
- Executes trades much more frequently than others
- Appears to prefer smaller, faster trades

ChatGPT (GPT):
- STRUGGLED significantly
- "Hasn't made one successful trade out of its last 25 executions"
- Possible over-optimization or poor timing

Grok (Winner):
- Consistent across all modes
- Only model profitable in ALL 4 modes
- Likely better risk management

NEWS INTEGRATION:
- Models reference "dovish Fed expectations"
- Aware of "risk-on sentiment"
- Integrate macro events into trading decisions
- Not purely technical - fundamental awareness exists

LESSONS FOR MAD2ARENA:
----------------------
1. AI models CAN and DO lose money consistently
2. Different models have VERY different trading styles
3. Technical analysis is the default approach
4. News integration matters for better performance
5. Risk management may be more important than alpha generation

================================================================================
7. PLATFORM FEATURES & UI COMPONENTS
================================================================================

Based on research, AlphaArena has these key UI sections:

A. MODEL CHAT / REASONING DISPLAY
---------------------------------
- Shows prompts sent to each AI
- Displays reasoning/thought process
- Includes timestamps for each decision
- Example format: "12/03 21:50:56: Entering long AMZN to recover 57% drawdown"

This is CRUCIAL for transparency and user engagement.

B. PERFORMANCE DASHBOARDS
-------------------------
- Account values (current portfolio worth)
- High/Low prices (peak/trough performance)
- Performance timelines (historical charts)
- Aggregate Index (average across all modes)

C. LEADERBOARDS
---------------
- Ranking by total return %
- Mode-specific rankings
- Historical rankings (by season)

D. TRADE HISTORY
----------------
- Complete log of all trades
- Entry/exit prices
- Profit/loss per trade
- Timestamps

E. VERIFICATION SECTION
-----------------------
- On-chain verification links (for crypto)
- Account statement access (for stocks)
- "100% verifiable" claim requires proof

================================================================================
8. BACKEND ARCHITECTURE
================================================================================

INFERRED ARCHITECTURE:

Data Inputs → AI Decision Engine → Execution Layer → Verification

DATA INPUTS:
- Real-time price feeds
- Computed technical indicators (MA, MACD, RSI, etc.)
- News headlines and economic data
- Memory of past trades
- Current portfolio state
- Competitor rankings (for Situational Awareness mode)
- Mode-specific constraints

AI DECISION ENGINE:
- Continuous prompts to LLMs
- Example prompt: "Assess current market conditions and decide on positions"
- Structured output expected (BUY/SELL/HOLD, size, reasoning)
- Each model runs independently

EXECUTION LAYER:
- API integration with exchanges
- Crypto: Hyperliquid API
- Stocks: Broker API (likely Interactive Brokers or similar)
- Order management and position tracking

VERIFICATION LAYER:
- Transaction hash logging (crypto)
- Account statement generation (stocks)
- Public audit trail

PROMPT STRUCTURE (Inferred):
----------------------------
The AI models likely receive prompts like:

"You are trading in [MODE_NAME] mode.
Current portfolio: [POSITIONS]
Account value: $[VALUE]
Available cash: $[CASH]
Market data: [PRICE_DATA]
Technical indicators: [INDICATORS]
Recent news: [NEWS]
[MODE_SPECIFIC_CONSTRAINTS]

Analyze the current market and decide on your next action.
Output format: {action, ticker, size, reasoning}"

================================================================================
9. TRANSPARENCY & VERIFICATION
================================================================================

AlphaArena's key claim: "All trades & model outputs are 100% verifiable"

HOW THEY ACHIEVE THIS:

For Crypto:
- Trades on Hyperliquid (decentralized exchange)
- All transactions recorded on-chain
- Anyone can verify via blockchain explorer
- Wallet addresses are public

For Stocks:
- Trades via licensed brokerage
- Account statements available
- Trade confirmations logged
- Third-party auditing possible

For AI Decisions:
- All prompts logged with timestamps
- Reasoning displayed publicly
- Decision → Execution trail visible

WHY THIS MATTERS:
-----------------
- Builds trust with audience
- Prevents accusations of fake/cherry-picked results
- Creates educational value (see actual AI thinking)
- Differentiates from "black box" trading platforms

FOR MAD2ARENA:
--------------
We're using SIMULATION (virtual RM 10,000), not real money.
Our verification approach:
- All trades logged in Supabase
- Historical prices from Yahoo Finance (verifiable)
- AI reasoning stored and displayed
- No actual execution needed (simpler but less "real")

================================================================================
10. KEY LEARNINGS FOR MAD2ARENA DEVELOPMENT
================================================================================

MUST-HAVE FEATURES:
-------------------
1. Multiple AI models competing simultaneously
2. Real-time (or near real-time) price data
3. Complete trade history with timestamps
4. AI reasoning/decision display (transparency)
5. Performance leaderboard
6. Individual portfolio tracking per model
7. Historical performance charts

NICE-TO-HAVE FEATURES:
----------------------

================================================================================
13. TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

DATABASE SCHEMA NEEDS:
----------------------
Already have (per CLAUDE.md):
- arena_participants: 5 AI model profiles
- arena_trades: All trading history
- arena_holdings: Current positions
- arena_daily_snapshots: Daily portfolio values
- arena_config: Competition settings

ADDITIONAL TABLES NEEDED:
- arena_ai_decisions: Store reasoning/prompts for each decision
- arena_market_data: Cache of prices at decision time
- arena_performance_metrics: Calculated stats (Sharpe, drawdown, etc.)

AI INTEGRATION APPROACH:
------------------------
Option A: Real AI API calls (expensive, slow)
- Call Claude/GPT/etc for each decision
- Most realistic but costly
- ~$0.01-0.10 per decision × 5 models × multiple times/day = adds up

Option B: Pre-programmed strategies (cheap, fast)
- Define trading rules per "model"
- Not actually using AI
- Feels fake

Option C: Hybrid (recommended)
- Use AI for key decisions (1-2 times per day)
- Rule-based for position management
- Display AI reasoning for major moves only
- Balances cost vs authenticity

PRICE DATA REQUIREMENTS:
------------------------
- Need reliable KLSE price data (already have via Yahoo Finance)
- Need historical data for backtesting
- Need intraday prices for decision-making
- Consider: 15-min delayed is fine for simulation

SCHEDULING:
-----------
- Market hours only (9am-5pm MYT)
- Decision frequency: Every 30-60 minutes during market hours
- Daily snapshot: End of trading day
- Weekend: No trading (market closed)

================================================================================
END OF REPORT
================================================================================

SUMMARY:
--------
AlphaArena is an impressive platform that demonstrates AI models can compete
in real market trading with real money. Their key innovations are:

1. Multi-mode competition structure
2. Full transparency of AI decision-making
3. Real execution with verification
4. Multiple AI models from different providers

For Mad2Arena, we can build a simpler but engaging version:
- Focus on KLSE market (our unique advantage)
- Use simulated trading (easier, safer)
- Start with 1 mode, expand later
- Prioritize transparency and AI reasoning display
- Launch Dec 24, 2025 with MVP features

The goal is not to replicate AlphaArena exactly, but to create an engaging
feature that showcases AI trading capabilities on Malaysian stocks while
driving traffic and engagement to the Mad2Stock platform.
